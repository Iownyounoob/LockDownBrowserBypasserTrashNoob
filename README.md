It's clear that it's trash, whoever coded it is trash and needs to get fired, if it's team they all need to get fired. It's time for a complete upgrade and a fresh team smarter, faster, younger people to take over similar to what companies like X and Facebook have done. You understand trash? This is not just a matter of software malfunction; it's about the impact on educational institutions and the trust placed in them. The trash security measures undermines the very essence of examinations and assessments."
